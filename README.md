A decentralized privacy toolkit for protecting against AI surveillance &amp; profiling.
# **Technocrat Firewall: AI-Resistant Privacy Toolkit**  

## 🚨 What is Technocrat Firewall?  
Technocrat Firewall is an **open-source digital defense system** designed to protect individuals from **AI-driven surveillance, tracking, and profiling**. Our goal is to develop **privacy-enhancing tools** that disrupt oppressive AI systems while ensuring secure, anonymous, and censorship-resistant communication.

## 🔥 Why This Matters  
Governments, corporations, and technocratic elites use AI to **track, profile, and manipulate individuals**. They collect metadata, recognize faces, and analyze online behavior to enforce control. **Technocrat Firewall fights back.**  

With this project, we are:  
✔ **Obscuring personal metadata** to prevent tracking  
✔ **Blocking AI facial recognition** to maintain anonymity  
✔ **Disrupting AI profiling** by injecting false data  
✔ **Building censorship-resistant communication tools**  

## 🛠️ Current Modules Under Development  
### 1️⃣ **AI Firewall & Metadata Scrambler**  
- **Forked from**: [Obfuscation Tool](https://github.com/Gebruiker/Obfuscation-Tool)  
- **What it does**:  
  - Prevents browser fingerprinting and online tracking  
  - Randomizes metadata to disrupt AI profiling  

### 2️⃣ **Facial Recognition Blocker (Image Obfuscation)**  
- **Forked from**: [Deep Privacy](https://github.com/hukkelas/DeepPrivacy)  
- **What it does**:  
  - Alters images before upload to block AI facial recognition  
  - Generates adversarial noise to fool surveillance cameras  

### 3️⃣ **AI Misdirection Bot**  
- **Forked from**: [Adversarial ML Toolbox](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox)  
- **What it does**:  
  - Engages surveillance AI with fake data patterns  
  - Creates misleading digital behavior to disrupt profiling  

## 📢 Get Involved! We Need Contributors  
We are looking for:  
✔ **Privacy Engineers** (Metadata obfuscation, anti-tracking)  
✔ **Cryptographers** (End-to-end encryption, zero-knowledge proofs)  
✔ **AI Security Experts** (Adversarial machine learning, AI deception)  
✔ **Open-Source Developers** (Python, JavaScript, WebRTC, Blockchain)
